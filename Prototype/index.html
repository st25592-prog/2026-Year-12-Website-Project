<h2>Welcome</h2>
<div>
<p>Rugby league is one of the most exciting and physically demanding sports in the world. Known for its speed, strength, and strategy, the game captures the attention of millions of fans across countries such as England, Australia, and New Zealand. With thirteen players on each team, rugby league is fast-paced and intense, requiring teamwork, discipline, and determination. The sport has grown from its humble beginnings in the late 19th century to become a professional global competition watched by millions every year.</p>

<h3>Why I love Rugby League</h3>
<div>
<p>Rugby league is my favourite sport because of the energy and passion it brings to both players and supporters. Every match is unpredictable, and the physical battles on the field make it thrilling to watch. I admire the teamwork involved, as every player has an important role in both attack and defence. The sport also represents pride and culture, especially in New Zealand, where the national team plays with determination and heart. Rugby league inspires resilience, commitment, and hard work, which is why it stands out to me more than any other sport.</p>
